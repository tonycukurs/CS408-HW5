# web-dev-starter

This is a starter project for web development with no frameworks and minimal
dependencies. It is intended to be a starting point for web development projects
that are written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

## Testing

To run the tests for the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Accessibility Lab Answers



    The text is difficult to read because of the current color scheme. Can you do a test of the current color contrast (text/background), report the results of the test, and then fix it by changing the assigned colors?

ANSWER: I chose a spectrum of pink and red colors because I think it provides a great contrast for the website. It also makes it easier to red black text on the website.


Semantic HTML

    The content is still not very accessible — report on what happens when you try to navigate it using a keyboard.

ANSWER: I cannot fully access everything with only using the tab key. For example I cannot use just the tab key to navigate all clickable links. I can use the arrow keys to navigate the website

    Can you update the article text to make it easier for screen reader users to navigate?

ANSWER:

    The navigation menu part of the site (wrapped in <div class="nav"></div>) could be made more accessible by putting it in a proper HTML semantic element. Which one should it be updated to? Make the update.

AMSWER:

Note: You'll need to update the CSS rule selectors that style the tags to their proper equivalents for the semantic headings. Once you add paragraph elements, you'll notice the styling looks better.
The Images

The images are currently inaccessible to screen reader users. Can you fix this?
The Audio Player

    The <audio> player isn't accessible to hearing impaired (deaf) people — can you add some kind of accessible alternative for these users?
    
    The <audio> player isn't accessible to those using older browsers that don't support HTML audio. How can you allow them to still access the audio?

The Forms

    The <input> element in the search form at the top could do with a label, but we don't want to add a visible text label that would potentially spoil the design and isn't really needed by sighted users. How can you add a label that is only accessible to screen readers?
    The two <input> elements in the comment form have visible text labels, but they are not unambiguously associated with their labels — how do you achieve this? Note that you'll need to update some of the CSS rule as well.

The Show/Hide Comment Control

The show/hide comment control button is not currently keyboard-accessible. Can you make it keyboard-accessible, both in terms of focusing it using the tab key and activating it using the return key?
The Table

The data table is not currently very accessible — it is hard for screen reader users to associate data rows and columns together, and the table also has no kind of summary to make it clear what it shows. Can you add some features to your HTML to fix this problem?
Other Considerations?

Can you list two more ideas for improvements that would make the website more accessible?
